Call this project flappy bird game and click on ok.

This is the default view of the project. We will make some changes to the XAML and the solutions explorer window.<br>

Download the images from above and right click on the flappy bird game in the solutions explorer.<br>

</p>

Hover over Add -> then click on new folder. This will make a new folder inside this project. Rename this folder to images and pressed enter.<br>

Now right click on the images folder -> Hover over Add -> and click on existing item<br>

</p>

Make sure you have extracted all of the images from the file you downloaded earlier. If the files are still inside of a ZIP file then visual studio won’t be able to add them to the project. From the file selection window find the folder with all of the images. If they don’t show up inside this box then you can change the file type to image files see in the screen shot below<br>

Once you found them and select all the images and click on Add.<br>

Now you can see the images are now showing in the solutions explorer. Let’s change some codes for the XAMl window.<br>
